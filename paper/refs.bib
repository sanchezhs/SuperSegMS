abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.}

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques represent a rapidly advancing field within artificial intelligence, gaining significant prominence in the detection and analysis of various medical conditions through the analysis of medical data. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on deep learning methods for the detection and analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The initial search identified 401 articles, which were rigorously screened, a selection of 82 highly relevant studies. These selected studies primarily concentrate on key areas such as multiple sclerosis, deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN), lesion segmentation, and classification, reflecting their alignment with the current state of the art. This review comprehensively examines diverse deep-learning approaches for MS detection and analysis, offering a valuable resource for researchers. Additionally, it presents key insights by summarizing these DL techniques for MS detection and analysis using MRI in a structured tabular format.}

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel approach to perform segmentation by leveraging the abstraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method is based on Hough voting, a strategy that allows for fully automatic localisation and segmentation of the anatomies of interest. This approach does not only use the CNN classification outcomes, but it also implements voting by exploiting the features produced by the deepest portion of the network. We show that this learning-based segmentation method is robust, multi-region, flexible and can be easily adapted to different modalities. In the attempt to show the capabilities and the behaviour of CNNs when they are applied to medical image analysis, we perform a systematic study of the performances of six different network architectures, conceived according to state-of-the-art criteria, in various situations. We evaluate the impact of both different amount of training data and different data dimensionality (2D, 2.5D and 3D) on the final results. We show results on both MRI and transcranial US volumes depicting respectively 26 regions of the basal ganglia and the midbrain.}

abstract = {Abstract For the last 15 years, super-resolution (SR) algorithms have successfully been applied to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to increase the spatial resolution of scans after acquisition has been performed, thus facilitating the doctors' diagnosis. The variety of application and techniques has grown ever since, especially in the MRI modality, showing the interest of the community to such postacquisition processing. This article presents a review of the general principle of SR as well as how this principle has been adapted to MRI data. The main algorithms and the principal acquisition protocols are detailed for both static and moving subjects. The presented strategies are discussed and compared according to the data specificities. Later, different ways of measuring the resolution enhancement and quantify the benefit of SR are detailed. Finally, unexplored perspectives on the application of SR to MRI data are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 40A: 306–325, 2012.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) images with both high resolutions and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are desired in many clinical and research applications. However, acquiring such images takes a long time, which is both costly and susceptible to motion artifacts. Acquiring MR images with good in-plane resolution and poor through-plane resolution is a common strategy that saves imaging time, preserves SNR, and provides one viewpoint with good resolution in two directions. Unfortunately, this strategy also creates orthogonal viewpoints that have poor resolution in one direction and, for 2D MR acquisition protocols, also creates aliasing artifacts. A deep learning approach called SMORE that carries out both anti-aliasing and super-resolution on these types of acquisitions using no external atlas or exemplars has been previously reported but not extensively validated. This paper reviews the SMORE algorithm and then demonstrates its performance in four applications with the goal to demonstrate its potential for use in both research and clinical scenarios. It is first shown to improve the visualization of brain white matter lesions in FLAIR images acquired from multiple sclerosis patients. Then it is shown to improve the visualization of scarring in cardiac left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Third, its performance on multi-view images of the tongue is demonstrated and finally it is shown to improve performance in parcellation of the brain ventricular system. Both visual and selected quantitative metrics of resolution enhancement are demonstrated.}

  abstract  = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.}

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision. In recent years, the performance of semantic segmentation has been greatly improved by using deep learning techniques. A large number of novel methods have been proposed. This paper aims to provide a brief review of research efforts on deep-learning-based semantic segmentation methods. We categorize the related research according to its supervision level, i.e., fully-supervised methods, weakly-supervised methods and semi-supervised methods. We also discuss the common challenges of the current research, and present several valuable growing research points in this field. This survey is expected to familiarize readers with the progress and challenges of semantic segmentation research in the deep learning era.}

abstract = {Deep convolutional networks–based super-resolution is a fast-growing field with numerous practical applications. In this exposition, we extensively compare more than 30 state-of-the-art super-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over three classical and three recently introduced challenging datasets to benchmark single image super-resolution. We introduce a taxonomy for deep learning–based super-resolution networks that groups existing methods into nine categories including linear, residual, multi-branch, recursive, progressive, attention-based, and adversarial designs. We also provide comparisons between the models in terms of network complexity, memory footprint, model input and output, learning details, the type of network losses, and important architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip-connections, filters). The extensive evaluation performed shows the consistent and rapid growth in the accuracy in the past few years along with a corresponding boost in model complexity and the availability of large-scale datasets. It is also observed that the pioneering methods identified as the benchmarks have been significantly outperformed by the current contenders. Despite the progress in recent years, we identify several shortcomings of existing techniques and provide future research directions towards the solution of these open problems.
